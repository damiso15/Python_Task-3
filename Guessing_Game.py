This function uses are; if the user inputs a number and the user number is more or less than the value 
randomly generated by the program, the user will be informed. Also, the user will be informed on how many trials they 
have left. If the user trial finishes before the user gets the randomly generated value, the program will stop running, 
and will inform the user the game is over displaying the randomly generated value. If the user gets the randomly
generated value before their trial ends, the program also stops and inform the user that they won.
